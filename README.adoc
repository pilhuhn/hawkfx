= Explorer for Hawkular

NOTE:: You need a version of Java8 later than 8u45, and as of now JRuby 9.1.5
is required, as later versions have a https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/4274[problem] that prevents JRubyFX from
working correctly.

http://hawkular.org/[Hawkular] is a set of components for Monitoring.
This explorer connects to a Hawkular server and allows to browse trough
inventory and view entities, graph metrics.

== Running

The explorer requires JRuby in version 9+ and Java8

If you are using `rvm` you can select it via

`rvm use jruby-9.1.5.0`

install and use `bundler` to install the required gems

`gem install bundler`

`bundle install`

then run:

`jruby -G -S hawkfx.rb`

Some ruby version managers (such as `rbenv`) do not provide a `jruby` binary
directly, if the previous command do not work you can try running the
application using bundler, like this:

`bundle exec ruby hawkfx.rb`

=== Using SSL

There is a blog post on the Hawkular
blog http://www.hawkular.org/blog/2016/09/14/consuming-hawkular-api-over-ssl.html[that describes how to use SSL] in Hawkular and HawkFX.
